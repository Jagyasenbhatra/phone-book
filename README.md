# PHONE BOOK




1. Project Overview:
   - You are building a software application in C language.
   - The main functionalities include adding, deleting,     updating, and searching phone numbers.
   - You’ll be using file handling to store and manage the phone numbers.
2. Functionality Descriptions:
     - Add Phone Number:
        - This function allows the user to input a new phone number along with a name or contact details.
        - The program should validate the input (e.g., check for valid phone number format).
        - The new entry should be appended to the existing phone book file.
        - Consider handling duplicate entries or ensuring uniqueness.
     - Delete Phone Number:
       - The user provides a phone number or name to delete.
       - The program searches for the entry in the phone book file.
       - If found, it removes the entry.
       - Handle cases where the entry doesn’t exist.
      - Update Phone Number:
        -  Similar to deletion, the user specifies a phone number or name.
        -  The program searches for the entry.
        - If found, it allows the user to update the contact details (e.g., change the name or number).
     -  Search Phone Number:
         - The user enters a phone number or name to search for.
        - The program looks up the entry in the phone book file.
         -  Display the contact details if found; otherwise, indicate that the entry doesn’t exist.
3.  File Handling:
    - You’ll create a text file (e.g., phonebook.txt) to store the phone numbers.
    -  Use file I/O functions (fopen, fprintf, fscanf, fclose) to read and write data.
   -  Consider error handling (e.g., file not found, permissions).
